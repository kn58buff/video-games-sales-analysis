# Video Games Sales Analysis

A data science and analysis project based on the [Video Games Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/video-games-sales/data) dataset posted by Ulrik Thyge Pedersen via Kaggle. This project was originally done for MTH412: Introduction to Statistical Inference as a final project. The original write-up and presentation can be found in [/class_original](https://github.com/kn58buff/video-games-sales-analysis/tree/9f648c6cedc92bd938f82725a995486aec18ca15/class_original). The root directory is an updated and more polished version of that project.
